Lab1: pretty self explanatory. pi code isn't contained here; only the lab report

Lab2: go to the following directory: Lab2/iot-lab-2/electron
do NOT go to the electron_tutorial or frontend_tutorial directories. You must run wifi_server.py on the pi, and run electron on the client side. Make sure you update the ip addresses.
